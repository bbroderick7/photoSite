  const Mapview = (props) => <div> Hello {props.name} </div>;
  export default Mapview;

    1: The Express Pipeline - enables easy to understand and clear workflows
        for processing data and interacting with databases

    2: The Express Built in Router - makes defining, building, deleting and
        changing routes very simple.

    3: Easy request and response generation - allows for very simple built
          in syntax for HTTP verbs and string Parsing

    4: Easy Templating with jade - express makes using and including template engines
          very straightforward and syntactically clean.


    Bonus 5th: Express also has a lot of built in features for error handling
          that work to ensure that when an error is thrown on the server,
          it is handled instead of crashing the server

    *I included 5 because "greatest may be kind of arbitrary depending on the program you are developing"
